          <h1>Hi, I'm Badr Almadhi</h1>
          <h3>Coding BootCamp Student</h3>
          <p>My journey into coding began at the University of Utah while pursuing my Bachelor's 
            degree in Architecture/Urban Planning. In my studies, I came across technologies like 
            Geographic Information System (GIS) and AutoCAD, where coding proved essential for 
            enhancing their functions. Intrigued, I spent a year teaching myself coding to see 
            if I wanted to make it my career. The more I learned, the more I fell in love with it. 
            Despite the challenges, I kept going. Eventually, I decided to attend a coding bootcamp 
            with Georgia Tech University, where I gained skills in both front-end and back-end 
            development, graduating successfully. Now, I'm excited to apply my knowledge and 
            looking for opportunities to kickstart my journey in tech development.</p>
